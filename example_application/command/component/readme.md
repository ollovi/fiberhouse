## Overview
    - Usage
    - CRON Expression Format
    - Special Characters
    - Predefined schedules
    - Intervals
    - Time zones
    - Thread safety
    - Implementation
## Usage 

- Callers may register Funcs to be invoked on a given schedule. Cron will run them in their own goroutines. 
```go
c := cron.New()
c.AddFunc("0 30 * * * *", func() { fmt.Println("Every hour on the half hour") })
c.AddFunc("@hourly",      func() { fmt.Println("Every hour") })
c.AddFunc("@every 1h30m", func() { fmt.Println("Every hour thirty") })
c.Start()
..
// Funcs are invoked in their own goroutine, asynchronously.
...
// Funcs may also be added to a running Cron
c.AddFunc("@daily", func() { fmt.Println("Every day") })
..
// Inspect the cron job entries' next and previous run times.
inspect(c.Entries())
..
c.Stop()  // Stop the scheduler (does not stop any jobs already running).
```

## CRON Expression Format

A cron expression represents a set of times, using 6 space-separated fields.

Field name   | Mandatory? | Allowed values  | Allowed special characters
----------   | ---------- | --------------  | --------------------------
Seconds      | Yes        | 0-59            | * / , -
Minutes      | Yes        | 0-59            | * / , -
Hours        | Yes        | 0-23            | * / , -
Day of month | Yes        | 1-31            | * / , - ?
Month        | Yes        | 1-12 or JAN-DEC | * / , -
Day of week  | Yes        | 0-6 or SUN-SAT  | * / , - ?

Note: Month and Day-of-week field values are case insensitive. "SUN", "Sun", and "sun" are equally accepted. 

Predefined schedules ¶

You may use one of several pre-defined schedules in place of a cron expression.

Entry                  | Description                                | Equivalent To
-----                  | -----------                                | -------------
@yearly (or @annually) | Run once a year, midnight, Jan. 1st        | 0 0 0 1 1 *
@monthly               | Run once a month, midnight, first of month | 0 0 0 1 * *
@weekly                | Run once a week, midnight between Sat/Sun  | 0 0 0 * * 0
@daily (or @midnight)  | Run once a day, midnight                   | 0 0 0 * * *
@hourly                | Run once an hour, beginning of hour        | 0 0 * * * *

## Intervals

You may also schedule a job to execute at fixed intervals, starting at the time it's added or cron is run. This is supported by formatting the cron spec like this:

@every <duration>

where "duration" is a string accepted by time.ParseDuration (http://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration).

For example, "@every 1h30m10s" would indicate a schedule that activates after 1 hour, 30 minutes, 10 seconds, and then every interval after that.

Note: The interval does not take the job runtime into account. For example, if a job takes 3 minutes to run, and it is scheduled to run every 5 minutes, it will have only 2 minutes of idle time between each run.
